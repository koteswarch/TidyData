# TidyData
Data Cleaning Project 

Instructions for reproducing the final tidy activity data:

1. Change the value of workDir in the run_analysis script with your current working directory. 
2. Place the directory containing all the raw input files in your working directory. 
3. Make sure you either manually create a folder named "TidyData" or change the script for that. 
4. Execute run_analysis.R
5. Final activity data with 180 observations on 88 varilables must be written to a CSV file named tidyActiityData.csv
